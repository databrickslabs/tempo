## Project Description
Welcome to Tempo: timeseries manipulation for Spark.
This project builds upon the capabilities of [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html) to provide
a suite of abstractions and functions that make operations on timeseries data easier and highly scalable.

*NOTE* that the Scala version of Tempo is now deprecated and no longer in development.
