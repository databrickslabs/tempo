```


### Starting Point: TSDF object, a wrapper over a Spark data frame
The entry point into all features for time series analysis in tempo is a TSDF object which wraps the Spark data frame. At a high level, a TSDF contains a data frame which contains many smaller time series, one per partition key. In order to create a TSDF object, a distinguished timestamp column much be provided in order for sorting purposes for public methods. Optionally, a sequence number and partition columns can be provided as the assumptive columns on which to create new features from. Below are the public methods available for TSDF transformation and enrichment.

## Quickstart - Python 

Data source is UCI public accelerometer data available at this URL https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heterogeneity+Activity+Recognition

#### 0. Read in Data and display it 

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import * 

phone_accel_df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("dbfs:/home/tempo/Phones_accelerometer").withColumn("event_ts", (col("Arrival_Time").cast("double")/1000).cast("timestamp")).withColumn("x", col("x").cast("double")).withColumn("y", col("y").cast("double")).withColumn("z", col("z").cast("double")).withColumn("event_ts_dbl", col("event_ts").cast("double"))

from tempo import * 

phone_accel_tsdf = TSDF(phone_accel_df, ts_col="event_ts", partition_cols = ["User"])

display(phone_accel_tsdf)
```

#### 1. Resample and Visualize

###### Sample usage: 
Possible values for frequency include patterns such as 1 minute, 4 hours, 2 days or simply sec, min, day. For the accepted functions to aggregate data, options are 'floor', 'ceil', 'min', 'max', 'mean'. Custom functions will be available in a future release.

Note: You can upsample any missing values by using an option in the resample interface (fill = True)

```python
# ts_col = timestamp column on which to sort fact and source table
# partition_cols - columns to use for partitioning the TSDF into more granular time series for windowing and sorting

resampled_sdf = phone_accel_tsdf.resample(freq='min', func='floor')
resampled_pdf = resampled_sdf.df.filter(col('event_ts').cast("date") == "2015-02-23").toPandas()

import plotly.graph_objs as go
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

# Plotly figure 1
fig = px.line(resampled_pdf, x='event_ts', y='z',
              color="User",
              line_group="User", hover_name="User")
fig.update_layout(title='Phone Accelerometer Usage' , showlegend=False)

fig.show()
```

#### 2. AS OF Join 
##### This join uses windowing in order to select the latest record from a source table and merges this onto the base Fact table


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databrickslabs/tempo/master/AS_OF_Join.png" width="700px"/>
</p>


```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import * 

watch_accel_df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("dbfs:/home/tempo/Watch_accelerometer").withColumn("event_ts", (col("Arrival_Time").cast("double")/1000).cast("timestamp")).withColumn("x", col("x").cast("double")).withColumn("y", col("y").cast("double")).withColumn("z", col("z").cast("double")).withColumn("event_ts_dbl", col("event_ts").cast("double"))

watch_accel_tsdf = TSDF(watch_accel_df, ts_col="event_ts", partition_cols = ["User"])

# Applying AS OF join to TSDF datasets
joined_df = watch_accel_tsdf.asofJoin(phone_accel_tsdf, right_prefix="phone_accel")

display(joined_df)
```

#### 3. Skew Join Optimized AS OF Join

The purpose of the skew optimized as of join is to bucket each set of `partition_cols` to get the latest source record merged onto the fact table

Parameters: 

ts_col = timestamp column for sorting 
partition_cols = partition columns for defining granular time series for windowing and sorting
tsPartitionVal = value to break up each partition into time brackets
fraction = overlap fraction
right_prefix = prefix used for source columns when merged into fact table

```python
joined_df = watch_accel_tsdf.asofJoin(phone_accel_tsdf, right_prefix="watch_accel", tsPartitionVal = 10, fraction = 0.1)
display(joined_df)
```

#### 4 - Approximate Exponential Moving Average

The approximate exponential moving average uses an approximation of the form `EMA = e * lag(col,0) + e * (1 - e) * lag(col, 1) + e * (1 - e)^2 * lag(col, 2) ` to define a rolling moving average based on exponential decay.

Parameters: 

window = number of lagged values to compute for moving average

```python
ema_trades = watch_accel_tsdf.EMA("x", window = 50)
display(ema_trades)
```

#### 5 - Simple Moving Average

Method for computing rolling statistics based on the distinguished timestamp column 

Parameters: 

rangeBackWindowSecs = number of seconds to look back

```python
moving_avg = watch_accel_tsdf.withRangeStats("y", rangeBackWindowSecs=600)
moving_avg.select('event_ts', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'mean_y').show(10, False)
```

#### 6 - Fourier Transform

Method for transforming the time series to frequency domain based on the distinguished data column 

Parameters: 

timestep = timestep value to be used for getting the frequency scale

valueCol = name of the time domain data column which will be transformed

```python
ft_df = tsdf.fourier_transform(timestep=1, valueCol="data_col")
display(ft_df)
```

#### 7- Interpolation
Interpolate a series to fill in missing values using a specified function. The following interpolation methods are supported: 

- Zero Fill : `zero`
- Null Fill: `null`
- Backwards Fill: `bfill`
- Forwards Fill: `ffill`
- Linear Fill: `linear`

The `interpolate` method can either be use in conjunction with `resample` or independently.

If `interpolate` is not chained after a `resample` operation, the method automatically first re-samples the input dataset into a given frequency, then performs interpolation on the sampled time-series dataset.

Possible values for frequency include patterns such as 1 minute, 4 hours, 2 days or simply sec, min, day. For the accepted functions to aggregate data, options are 'floor', 'ceil', 'min', 'max', 'mean'. 

`NULL` values after re-sampling are treated the same as missing values. Ability to specify `NULL` as a valid value is currently not supported.

Valid columns data types for interpolation are: `["int", "bigint", "float", "double"]`.

```python
# Create instance of the TSDF class
input_tsdf = TSDF(
            input_df,
            partition_cols=["partition_a", "partition_b"],
            ts_col="event_ts",
        )


# What the following chain of operation does is:
# 1. Aggregate all valid numeric columns using mean into 30 second intervals
# 2. Interpolate any missing intervals or null values using linear fill
# Note: When chaining interpolate after a resample, there is no need to provide a freq or func parameter. Only method is required.
interpolated_tsdf = input_tsdf.resample(freq="30 seconds", func="mean").interpolate(
    method="linear"
)

# What the following interpolation method does is:
# 1. Aggregate columnA and columnBN  using mean into 30 second intervals
# 2. Interpolate any missing intervals or null values using linear fill
interpolated_tsdf = input_tsdf.interpolate(
    freq="30 seconds",
    func="mean",
    target_cols= ["columnA","columnB"],
    method="linear"

)

# Alternatively it's also possible to override default TSDF parameters.
# e.g. partition_cols, ts_col a
interpolated_tsdf = input_tsdf.interpolate(
    partition_cols=["partition_c"],
    ts_col="other_event_ts"
    freq="30 seconds",
    func="mean",
    target_cols= ["columnA","columnB"],
    method="linear"
)

# The show_interpolated flag can be set to `True` to show additional boolean columns 
# for a given row that shows if a column has been interpolated.
interpolated_tsdf = input_tsdf.interpolate(
    partition_cols=["partition_c"],
    ts_col="other_event_ts"
    freq="30 seconds",
    func="mean",
    method="linear",
    target_cols= ["columnA","columnB"],
    show_interpolated=True,
)

```

#### 8 - Grouped Stats by Frequency

Group by partition columns and a frequency to get the minimum, maximum, count, mean, standard deviation, and sum for all or some subset of numeric columns.

###### Parameters: 

`freq` = (required) Frequency at which the grouping should take place - acceptable parameters are strings of the form "1 minute", "40 seconds", etc.

`metricCols` = (optional) List of columns to compute metrics for. These should be numeric columns. If this is not supplied, this method will compute stats on all numeric columns in the TSDF

```python
grouped_stats = watch_accel_tsdf.withGroupedStats(metricCols = ["y"], freq="1 minute")
display(grouped_stats)
```
